Dear Hiring Managers:

A little about me.
I'm a large-city dweller, which in my later adult life, decided to move to Colorado. I enjoy the outdoors, camping, trail-running, and (big surprise) craft breweries.

The Rails framework changed my web development experience (into a pleasent one) in 2006. I made some early plugins [lightbox](https://github.com/jtarchie/rails_lightbox) and [xml cache](https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/t/xml-builder-cache-with-a-slight-problem-on-initial-load/15876). Used it professionally for 10+ years at several companies, with the biggest experience and impact at Pivotal Labs.

I've been at the Pivotal for 10+ years. For four years, it was client engagements to build apps using Rails and Javascript, using TDD, pair programming, and Agile product managment. The most important thing I learned is having a process to building a product helps teams streamline, focus, and align on sustainable deliverables.

For the past five years, I moved away from Rails to Golang and backend cloud systems (refraining from adding buzzwords). Mainly to validate one thing, that I could program in other domains besides web apps for startups and still apply the same product development methodologies.

Validated!

I've been able to help rescue products, mentor new engineers (❤️), and create balanced teams. I've been effective in building and continuously delivering software in a corporate environment, which is a challenge!

I'm ready for my next challenge.
I enjoy building products that people enjoy using.
And (and many others) enjoy outdoor acitvites and capturing that experience.
I have the experience and toolset to provide value to any team.
And would really appreciate working with like minded folks.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind Regards,

JT Archie
