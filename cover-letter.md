Dear Hiring Managers:

<job description>

I've been at Pivotal for 10+ years. For four years, it was client engagements to build apps using Rails and Javascript, using TDD, pair programming, and Agile product management. The most important thing I learned is having a process to build a product helps teams streamline, focus, and align on sustainable deliverables.

For the past six years, I moved away from Rails to Golang and distributed cloud systems. To validate I could program in other domains besides web apps for startups and still apply the same product development methodologies.

Validated!

I've been able to help rescue products, mentor new engineers (❤️), and create balanced teams. I've been effective in building and continuously delivering software in a corporate environment, which is a challenge! I grew to love CI/CD, so much that a personal motto is, "Automate yourself out of a job."

I'm ready for my next challenge.
I enjoy building products that people enjoy using.
I have the experience and toolset to provide value to any team.
And would really appreciate working with like minded folks.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kind Regards,

JT Archie
