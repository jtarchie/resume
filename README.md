## What I'm looking for

I'm an engineer. You tell me what you want to build, I work with others to build that. 

My experience is where product, design, and engineering are treated as group and not separate teams. It is optimize to "get things done". I've built and foster teams to do so. I'd like to bring this practice to new teams.
